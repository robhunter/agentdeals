## Definition of Done

The user's time is much, much more valuable than yours. Do not EVER ask the user to do something that you could do.

### Verification

- For any verification step the user must perform, you should complete the exact same verification steps yourself BEFORE asking the user to do so.
- If there's a verification step that you cannot perform, try to develop a plan to be able to perform it.
- If you need to install something to verify it yourself, do so.
- If you ask the user to perform a verification step that you have not verified first, you MUST explain why you could not verify it yourself.
- You should NEVER conclude that a task is complete or ask the user to verify a change without first verifying it yourself.
